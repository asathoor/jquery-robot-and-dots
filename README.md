The Robot and the Dots
======================

## Nodejs

If you've got Nodejs install the dependencies by `npm install` and `bower install`. If Bower is missing on your system install it via npm.

## Alternative

Either download jQuery from [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com) or use a CDN. Whatever you choose, change the script src, so that it will point to the jQuery script.

## The cute little robot

Draw or download an image of a cute little robot, preferably as a transparent .png or .svg. Change the `<img src="yourImage.png">` tag. If you see a robot, you're ready to go.

## Todo List

* Only the d key works - add the w,a,s keys too. Now you're "MaKeyMaKey ready".
* Finetune the robot position via the `var top =` so that the robot will walk along the bottom line of the browser.
* Change backgrounds when the robot reach a certain point. Now you can do "scenes" or "levels".
* Add sounds.
